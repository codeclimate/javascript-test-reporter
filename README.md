## Installation

This npm package requires having a user (but not necessarily a paid account) on Code Climate, so if you don't have one the
first step is to create an account at: [https://codeclimate.com](https://codeclimate.com). Then:

1. Generate coverage data in [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov/geninfo.1.php) format

      Lcov data can be generated by a number of JavaScript code coverage tools, including [Istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul).

1. Install codeclimate's NPM package

          $ npm install -g codeclimate-test-reporter

1. Specifying your repo token as an environment variable, send lcov coverage data to the codeclimate npm script.

      For example, if your coverage data resides in a "lcov.info" file:

          CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN=ABCD11110000000 codeclimate < lcov.info

The `CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN` value is provided after you add your repo to your
Code Climate account by clicking on "Setup Test Coverage" on the right hand side of your feed.

Please contact hello@codeclimate.com if you need any assistance setting this up.
